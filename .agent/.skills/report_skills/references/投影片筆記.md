Abstract

Recent advancements in noisy multi-label text

classification have primarily relied on the class-

conditional noise (CCN) assumption, which

treats each label independently undergoing la-

bel flipping to generate noisy labels. How-

ever, in real-world scenarios, noisy labels often

exhibit dependencies with true labels. In

this study, we validate through hypothesis test-

ing that real-world datasets are unlikely to ad-

here to the CCN assumption, indicating that

label noise is dependent on the current labels.

To address this, we introduce a label-specific

denoising framework designed to counteract

label-dependent noise. The framework ini-

tially presents a holistic selection metric that

evaluates noisy labels by concurrently consid-

ering loss information, ranking information,

and feature centroid. Subsequently, it identi-

fies and corrects noisy labels individually for

each label category in a fine-grained manner.

Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets

demonstrate the effectiveness of our method

under both synthetic and real-world noise con-

ditions, significantly improving performance

over existing state-of-the-art models.

1 Introduction

Multi-label text classification (MLTC) aims to pre-

dict the most relevant labels for each text from

a label set. In real applications, noise is in-

evitably present in the data of MLTC (Snow et al.,

2008; Chen et al., 2023). It poses a significant

challenge for machine learning models, particu-

larly deep learning models (Frénay and Verleysen,

2014; Arazo et al., 2019). In noisy multi-label

classification, most existing methods rely on the

class-conditional noise (CCN) assumption (Li et al.,

2022b; Xia et al., 2023; Xie and Huang, 2023; Song

et al., 2024). This assumption posits that label noise

originates from independent label flipping for each

category, with each category having a distinct flip-

ping probability.

However, in practice, noisy labels often exhibit

a certain degree of correlation with the true labels

(Cui et al., 2020; Xie and Huang, 2022). As shown

in Figure 1, due to category ambiguity, lack of ex-

pert knowledge, or the influence of attention shift

(Wu et al., 2023), annotators are more likely to mis-

label the current document as “Moon” or “Earth”

instead of unrelated labels such as “Pytorch” or

“Tensorflow”.

In this paper, our first contribution (Section 2) is

to propose a theoretical hypothesis test on the real-

world dataset Riedel (Chen et al., 2023) to demon-

strate that real-world multi-label noise is less likely

to be CCN, and more likely to be label-dependent

noise (LDN), where the occurrence of label noise

depends on the positive labels associated with the

current sample. To mitigate noisy multi-label text

classification under LDN, our second contribution

(Section 2) is to introduce for generating control-

lable LDN and analyze the characteristics of train-

ing under LDN. Our third contribution (Section

3) is the proposal of a Label-Sp ecific Denoising

(LeD) framework to address LDN. LeD initially

porating ranking-enhanced loss (REL) and centroid

distance (CD) to assess labels from both output and

feature perspectives. Following this, LeD employs

the HSM to conduct label-specific noise identifica-

tion and correction for each label category. The

superior performance of LeD is verified in exten-

sive experiments, under LDN with varying noise

fractions, including on real-world benchmarks.

2 From CCN to LDN

In this section, we introduce the problem setting

of noisy multi-label classification from traditional

class-conditional noise (CCN) assumption to our

proposed label-dependent noise (LDN) assumption.

In what follows, sets are in calligraphic letters (e.g.,

A), matrices are in capital bold letters(e.g., A),

vectors are in lower-case bold letters (e.g., a), and

scalars are in capital or lower-case letters (e.g. A,

a). For simplicity, let [L] ={1, ..., L}. Addition-

ally, proofs of theorems can be found in Appendix

A.1.

2.1 Preliminaries

Considering a multi-label classification problem,

the input of training stage includes Ninstances

D={(xi,yi)}N

i=1, each of which consists

of an input vector xiand output labels yi=

(Yi,1, Yi,2, ..., Y i,L)∈ {0,1}Lrelated to the input.

Here Lis the total number of candidate labels. In

real-world scenarios, it is often not possible to di-

rectly observe the true labels y. Instead, we have

an observable distribution of noisy labels ˜yand a

noisy training set ˜D={(xi,˜yi)}N

i=1. In noisy

multi-label classification, our goal is to predict

proper labels for each unseen instance by only us-

ing the noisy training set.

2.2 Class-Conditional Noise Assumption

The class-conditional noise assumption is com-

monly used in previous works (Chen et al., 2019;

Li et al., 2022b; Xie and Huang, 2023; Chen et al.,

2023) on noisy multi-label classification.

Definition 1. (Noise transition matrix) In multi-

label classification, the random variables ˜Y·,jand

Y·,jfor the label jare related through a noise tran-

sition matrix Tj∈[0,1]2∗2, j∈[L]. Generally,

the transition matrix depends on instances (feature

xand labels y), i.e.,Tj

k,l(x,y) =P(˜Yj=k|Yj=

l,x,y), where kandl∈ {0,1}.

Definition 2. (Class-conditional noise) Under

the class-conditional assumption, the transitionmatrix is assumed class-conditional and instance-

independent, i.e., Tj

k,l(x,y) =Tj

k,l=P(˜Yj=

k|Yj=l).

As illustrated in Figure 1, in the context of noisy

multi-label learning, there exist two types of noise:

false positives and false negatives. Among them,

false positives often exhibit a strong label correla-

tion with the ground truth y. Therefore, we argue

that real-world multi-label noise should at least be

label-dependent , i.e.,Tj

k,l(y) =P(˜Yj=k|Yj=

l,y). To underscore the importance of moving be-

yond the CCN assumption, which pertains to label-

independent noise (LIN), we theoretically validate

its significance through hypothesis testing.

Definition 3. (Label flip) Given the noisy dataset ˜D,

consider randomly sampling a validation set ˜D′=

{(xi,˜yi)}n

i=1, and assume we also know the clean

labels{yi}n

i=1corresponding to the validation set.

We define the random variable Zj={˜Yj|Yj= 0},

where Zjrepresents the event that the jthclass

of the current sample flip from a negative label to

a positive label. Here, Zj∈ {0,1}, with a flip

probability of Tj

1,0(x,y).

Theorem 1. If CCN assumption holds, then for

∀j0, j1∈[L], random variables Zj0andZj1are

independent.

Next, we verify the independence of Zj0andZj1

through hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis H0

and the corresponding alternative hypothesis H1

are defined as follows:

H0:Zj0, Zj1are independent;

H1:Zj0, Zj1are dependent.

By applying the chi-square test to the real-world

noisy multi-label benchmark Riedel (Chen et al.,

2019, 2023), the hypothesis testing results show

thatχ2= 940 .5with a p-value of 1.5e−206, indi-

cating that the result is highly statistically signif-

icant. Thus, the null hypothesis H0is rejected

with the significance value. Hypothesis “ H1:

Zj0, Zj1are dependent. ” is accepted. Therefore,

based on Theorem 1, we can conclude that the

CCN assumption does not hold on Riedel . Please

refer to Appendix A.2 for more details.

2.3 Label-Dependent Noise

Now both the intuition and theoretical evidence

imply that multi-label noise should be dependent on

labels. As presented in Definition 4, we can model

label-dependent mislabelling among given labels.

Definition 4. (Label-dependent noise) Under the5675

label-dependent assumption, the transition matrix

isTj

k,l(x,y) =Tj

k,l(y) =P(˜Yj=k|Yj=l,y)

CCN can be seen as a degenerated case of LDN

assumption such that all instances have the same

noise transition matrix. By assuming LDN, we

can better model the label correlation of real-world

multi-label noise, as depicted in Figure 1. Note that

LDN is also a special case of instance-dependent

noise (IDN) (Chen et al., 2021). Its noise transi-

tion depends on the labels corresponding to each

instance.

Previous works on noisy multi-label classifica-

tion under CCN assumption often conducted ex-

periments on synthetic noise with varying noise

fractions (Li et al., 2022b; Chen et al., 2023). They

randomly flip an element Yi,jin the label vector yi

from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 by the probability Tj

1,0and

Tj

0,1respectively, thereby generating noise labels

of false positives and false negatives. Similarly, it

is desired to easily generate LDN with any noise

fraction for any given benchmark dataset. To stim-

ulate the development of theory and methodology,

we propose a novel LDN generator.

As shown in Figure 1, the LDN assumption pri-

marily manifests in the generation of false positive

noise. for the generation of false negative noise la-

bels, we adopt the method used in previous studies

(Li et al., 2022b), which involves a fixed transition

probability Tj

0,1=T0,1=ρ+. For the generation

of false positive noise, we follow a label depen-

dency approach, meaning that true negative labels

with strong label correlation to the ground truth are

more likely to be flipped to false positive labels

(Liang et al., 2023). We simulate the label flips

based on a label correlation matrix C, which can

be obtained through the label co-occurrence ma-

trix (Su et al., 2022). Each element Cj0,j1ofCis

defined as:

Cj0,j1=cj0,j1/summationtextL

j=1cj0,j, j0, j1∈[L] (1)

cj0,j1=/braceleftigg

0 j0=j1/summationtextN

i=1Yi,j0·Yi,j1j0̸=j1(2)

The probability Tj

0,1(y)of a true negative label

jtransitioning to a false positive label should be

related to the current set of positive labels for thesample.

pj(y,C) =



0 yj= 1/summationtext

j0:yj0=1Cj0,j/summationtext

j0:yj0=11yj= 0

(4)

Here, ρ−controls the extent of negative labels tran-

sitioning. pj(y,C)denotes the probability of a neg-

ative label jtransitioning to a positive label given

the current set of labels and the label correlation

matrix. The label noise is label-dependent since it

takes into account the label set of each instance.

In some works (Chen et al., 2023; Ghiassi et al.,

2022), it was assumed that ρ−=ρ+. However,

we argue against this approach because in MLTC,

the label dimension Lis usually much larger than

the average number of labels per instance Lavg.

Therefore, if ρ−=ρ+, the number of false positive

(FP) labels would be much greater than the number

of false negative (FN) labels. This situation does

not accurately reflect the challenges of NMLTC

problems. Hence, we adopt the approach proposed

in Multi-T (Li et al., 2022b), setting ρ+=ρand

ρ−=Lavg

L−Lavgρ. This configuration is designed to

ensure that the difference between the number of

FP labels and FN labels is relatively small. The

noise rate ρis set to 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6. The algorithm

of LDN generation can be found in the Appendix

B.1.

2.4 Characterizations of Training with LDN

In noisy label learning, a simple yet effective

method to identify label noise is to utilize the mem-

orization effect (Arazo et al., 2019). This effect

highlights that DNNs tend to learn simple and gen-

eral patterns before memorizing the noise, inspiring

many sample selection based approaches (Lu et al.,

2023; Song et al., 2024). Existing methods have

confirmed that this approach can also be applied

under CCN conditions (Li et al., 2022b; Song et al.,

2024). However, can this method be used in

NMLTC under LDN conditions? Here, we conduct

an empirical study to compare the performance

of these two types of noise. We generate 40%

LDN noise and conduct experiments on the AAPD

dataset. Simultaneously, we generate 40% CCN

noise for comparison. In all experiments presented

in this paper, the DNN model and training hyper-

parameters we use are consistent.5676

LDN is harder to identify Figure 2 shows the

changes in loss values for randomly sampled clean

and noisy labels during training (under both CCN

and LDN conditions). If we use the small loss cri-

terion (Li et al., 2022b; Song et al., 2024) to filter

noisy samples, we find that noisy samples are rel-

atively easier to identify under CCN. During the

early epochs of training, clean and noisy labels ex-

hibit a significant difference. However, under LDN,

clean and noisy labels are not easily distinguishable.

In addition, we carried out a quantitative analysis,

as shown in Figure 3. We illustrate the contrast

in distribution of loss between labels affected by

noise versus clean ones. It can be seen that under

CCN noise, the overlap between the clean region

and the noisy region is small, indicating that it is

easier to identify the noise. In contrast, under LDN,

it is relatively difficult to identify the noise due to

the larger overlap. The reason is that LDN is

very similar to the correct labels, making it prone

to overfitting and thus difficult to distinguish from

the correct labels. Additional observations can be

found in Appendix B.2.

3 Method

Previous work (Han et al., 2018; Northcutt et al.,

2021; Song et al., 2024) has identified noisy labels

based on the “memorization effect”, using the loss

values from early epochs of deep learning models.

However, as shown in section 2, this approach faces

challenges with LDN due to its similarity to the true

labels. Therefore, in this section, we propose a

Label-Sp ecific Denoising (LeD) framework. This

framework considers various aspects of neural net-work training, including loss, ranking, and feature

space neighbors, which provide a more compre-

hensive reflection of the likelihood that a label is

noisy. Specifically, we introduce a holistic selec-

tion metric (HSM) that includes ranking-enhanced

loss (REL) and centroid distance (CD). We then

identify noisy labels for each label category from

the perspective of each individual label category.

We use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to iden-

tify noisy labels among positive and negative labels

for each category, resulting in a noise probability

for each label. Based on these noise probabilities,

we refine the original labels in a fine-grained man-

ner. The corrected labels are then used for retrain-

ing the model. The overall framework is shown

in Figure 4.

3.1 Noisy Multi-Label Text Classification

The goal of noisy multi-label text classification

(NMLTC) is to learn a function fthat maps the

input instance xiand a label lto a relevance score

ˆYi,j=f(xi, j). We constructed the scoring

function fby combining a text encoder ϕand a

multi-label classifier ψ. Following the approach of

previous works (Su et al., 2022; Tan et al., 2024;

Chai et al., 2024), we employed a BERT-based text

encoder ϕand adopted a multi-layer MLP as our

multi-label classifier ψ. We then employed binary

cross entropy (BCE) LBCE=/summationtextN

l=1Li,jas

the loss function, where

Li,j=−(˜Yi,jlog(ˆYi,j) + (1−˜Yi,j) log(1 −ˆYi,j)).

(5)

The notation Li,jrepresents the loss value associ-

ated with the j-th label for the i-th instance.

3.2 Holistic Selection Metric

Due to the presence of LDN, noisy labels and cor-

rect labels appear more similar, making it difficult

to effectively identify noisy samples using a sin-

gle metric, such as loss information. Therefore,

we propose to jointly use two metrics from differ-

ent perspectives: ranking-enhanced loss (REL) and

centroid distance (CD). REL fully utilizes the in-

formation from prediction confidence, while CD

relies on the distance in the feature space.

3.2.1 Ranking-Enhanced Loss

When learning with noisy labels, it is commonly

observed that instances with clean labels typically

have smaller loss values than those with noisy

labels (Han et al., 2018; Northcutt et al., 2021).5677

HSM denotes the holistic selection metric.

However, relying solely on the loss value Li,jto

identify LDN, we may overlook differences be-

tween samples. For instance, some difficult labels

may have a relatively high loss Li,j, but their pre-

diction ˆYi,j∈ˆyicould still be correct. Therefore,

we propose using the model’s predicted ranking

of labels as an additional metric. A smaller pre-

dicted ranking for a label indicates it is more likely

to be clean. Label ranking can reveal distinctions

between labels at the sample level. For each in-

stance xiand its predicted label ˆ yi, we can ob-

tain the rank of each label using the rank function

Rank (ˆyi) = ( Ri,1, Ri,2, ..., R i,L), where Ri,jis

the rank metric for ˆYi,j. To combine ranking

information with loss information, we propose the

ranking-enhanced loss (REL) by adding an extra

weight to the loss information. Thus, REL Ei,jcan

be calculated by:

W(ˆYi,j) = min(log( Ri,j) + 1, θ), (6)

Ei,j=W(ˆYi,j)×Li,j. (7)

The logarithmic function is used to constrain the

scale of the rank values, and a fixed value θis em-

ployed for truncation to ensure that it has a limited

impact on the loss information.

3.2.2 Centroid Distance

Although the sample separability achieved through

REL is better, the separation metric still relies on

model prediction. This reliance means there is still

a risk of overfitting the classifier, especially in the

case of LDN, where label noise often occurs among

similar labels, increasing the likelihood of classifier

overfitting. Consequently, this leads to low discrim-

ination between the model predictions of clean and

noisy labels. Therefore, solely using REL may notbe sufficient to distinguish clean labels from noisy

ones when model predictions are close.

Except for separating the samples in the output

space, we propose an additional metric computed

in the feature space to mitigate the bias introduced

by the classifier, as the learned features can handle

noise labels better. Specifically, we proposed the

centroid distance (CD) metric. for a given sample,

we can compute the distance between its feature

and the class feature centroid to assess the extent

to which the sample’s feature differs from its class

centroid. To improve the quality of the class

feature centroid for distance calculation, we con-

struct the feature centroid by incorporating high-

confidence samples from the observed class. The

class centroid cjbased on a high-confidence sam-

ple set Hjis calculated by:

weight wiincreases when a sample’s prediction

confidence of class jis higher than its class average

¯Yj. Thus, the threshold is high enough to ensure

the quality of the selected samples. Therefore,

the proposed metric CD Di,jcan be calculated by

Di,j=−cos(vi,cj).

To facilitate the integration of these two met-

rics, we perform min-max normalization on them

(Hu et al., 2022), obtaining normalized results ˆEi,j

andˆDi,jrespectively. The linear combination

of both metrics results in a new holistic selection

metric (HSM) Mi,j=α·ˆEi,j+ (1−α)ˆDi,j.

The combination coefficient αplays a crucial role

in determining the balance between the two met-

rics. By combining the advantages of both met-

rics, HSM effectively captures both the confidence

from model predictions and the robustness from the

feature space, thus improving the discrimination

between clean and noisy labels.

3.3 Fine-Grained Label-Specific Correction

As previously mentioned, there are two types of

noise in noisy multi-labels: false positive and false

negative. In this section, we take false positive

noise as an example, with the method for handling

false negative noise being similar. After obtain-

ing the HSM for each label, we proceed with the

identification and fine-grained correction of noisy

labels based on each label category. Fine-grained

label-specific correction involves re-labeling the

noisy dataset based on the HSM values to create a

cleaner training set.

If noisy labels are divided globally (without dis-

tinguishing between categories), the differences

between categories will be ignored. Some diffi-

cult categories may all be classified as noise, while

some simple categories may not be classified as

noise at all. Therefore, we individually identify

noisy labels for each class. We first obtain

the HSM set M+

jcorresponding to all positive

labels for label j, i.e., M+

j={Mi,j|˜Yi,j= 1}.

True labels have lower HSM values compared to

noisy ones due to DNNs’ memorization effect

(Arpit et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2023). Therefore,

we employ a bi-modal univariate Gaussian mix-

ture model (GMM) for each HSM set using the

expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, result-

ing in LGMM models for positive labels.

Given the HSM, its clean-label probability is

obtained by the posterior probability PG(˜Yi,j)of

the corresponding GMM, Since distinguishingDatasets Ntrn Ntst L L avgNavg

between noisy and clean labels near the decision

boundary is challenging, we have employed a fine-

grained correction strategy, as opposed to using

hard pseudo-labels (Li et al., 2020). The specific

approach is as follows:

PG(˜Yi,j) 0.5−ϵ < P G(˜Yi,j)≤0.5 +ϵ

(12)

The corrected pseudo-label ˇYi,jis obtained. The

implication is that if PG(˜Yi,j)is large, we consider

the label to be likely a clean label and thus keep

it unchanged. Conversely, if PG(˜Yi,j)is small, we

consider the label to be likely incorrect and thus

perform label flipping. When the value of PG(˜Yi,j)

is close to 0.5, it is difficult to determine the noise

situation, so we adopt a soft label approach.

4.1 Experimental Setup

Datasets Following previous work (Chen et al.,

2023), we evaluate the proposed model on three

synthetic benchmark datasets namely MOVIE ,

AAPD , and RCV1 with varying LDN fractions.

Table 1 contains the statistics of these three bench-

mark datasets.

Evaluation Metrics For a comprehensive and re-

liable evaluation, we follow conventional settings

(Chen et al., 2019, 2023) and report the following

metrics: micro-F1 (mi-F1), macro-F1 (ma-F1) and

mean Average Precision (mAP). Note that only the

training set is affected by noise, whereas the evalu-

ation metrics are computed on the clean testing set.

The best results are in bold, and the second-best

results are in underscore.

Baselines To verify the effectiveness of LeD, we

selected the nine most representative baseline mod-

els in three groups. (1) MLTC methods: AttXML

4.2 Experimental Results

Main Results As depicted in Tables 2-4, we have

observed the following phenomena: (1) In all cases,

our method shows significant improvements com-

pared to other methods. By utilizing a holistic

selection metric, we evaluate labels from multiple

perspectives, enabling finer-grained identification

and correction of noisy labels, which leads to op-

timal experimental results. (2) Due to overfitting

to noisy labels, most existing MLTC methods tend

to perform worse compared to NMLL methods.(3) NMLL methods like RTM and Multi-T depend

only on loss for noise rate estimation, which is in-

adequate under LDN. Similarly, nEM and MLLSC

are constrained by insufficiently sensitive metrics

to detect noisy labels.

Experiments on the Real-world Dataset The

Riedel dataset (Chen et al., 2023) is a large-scale

real-world NMLTC dataset, containing 53 classes,

each representing a different relation. It is derived

from the New York Times corpus. The training

data consists of 281,270 instances, while the test

set includes 3,762 instances. We used the same

backbone as nEM to ensure a fair comparison. The

results, shown in Table 5, indicate that our method

outperforms the best baseline by 10% in terms of

the ma-F1 metric, demonstrating the effectiveness

of our approach on the real-world NMLTC dataset.5680

Ablation Study In the following experiments,

we aim to analyze the effectiveness of each compo-

nent of the proposed LeD method on three datasets.

The LDN ratio is 0.4. We compare the complete

LeD method with the following variants: (a) HSM

(Loss): This variant uses only the loss as the metric

for identifying noisy labels. (b) HSM (REL): This

variant uses the REL metric for identifying. (c)

HSM (CD): This variant uses the CD metric for

identifying. According to Table 6, we observe that

the different components of the HSM metric collec-

tively contribute to enhancing the quality of noise

identification. By incorporating instance-level rank

information, the model gains the ability to differen-

tiate between different instances, enabling a more

accurate distinction between clean and corrupted

labels. Additionally, the introduction of the feature-

based metric, CD, significantly contributes to noise

identification.

Effectiveness of HSM In Figure 5, we present

the distributions of the positive label "cs.IT" in the

AAPD dataset using HSM(Loss), HSM(REL), and

HSM(CD). Firstly, as shown in (a) and (b), lossHSM Dataset

information demonstrates a certain capability in

noise identification. When rank information is in-

troduced, using REL as a metric, the noise identifi-

cation capability is significantly enhanced (reduced

overlapping areas). From (c), we can observe the

complementary nature of the prediction-based REL

metric and the feature-based CD metric. Finally,

in (d), it is evident that combining both metrics in

HSM results in a significantly improved noise iden-

tification capability (minimal overlapping areas).

5 Related Work

Learning from Noisy Labels In multi-class clas-

sification with noisy labels, most approaches lever-

age the memorization effect of deep neural net-

works (DNNs) (Arpit et al., 2017), where simple

and generalized patterns are learned before over-

fitting to noisy patterns. Specifically, small-loss

instances are likely to be clean instances (Han et al.,

2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2020). Another

approach involves sample selection based on fea-

ture distributions (Li et al., 2022a, 2023). Recent

methods (Hu et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023) have

proposed more comprehensive evaluation metrics

to distinguish between clean and corrupted data,5681

considering aspects such as information through-

out the training process and prediction confidence.

Inspired by these approaches, we propose a holistic

selection metric for noisy MLTC that integrates

various noise label characteristics, including multi-

label ranking and feature information.

Noisy Multi-Label Learning Noisy Multi-Label

Learning is an emerging research topic due to the

complexity of noise mechanisms in multi-label

settings compared to multi-class problems. Zhao

et al. (2021) introduced pre-trained label embed-

dings for regularization, achieving robust learning.

GCE (Zhang and Sabuncu, 2018), WISC (Hu et al.,

2019), and MLLSC (Ghiassi et al., 2022) developed

robust loss functions by weighting labels. Meth-

ods like RTM (Patrini et al., 2017) and Multi-T (Li

et al., 2022b) address the estimation problem of

noise transition matrices in the multi-label context.

The nEM method (Chen et al., 2023) uses latent

variable models to model the transition process of

noisy labels, achieving robust MLTC. Xia et al.

(2023) identifies noisy labels through label corre-

lation. Song et al. (2024) employs the small loss

trick for noisy label selection and correction. How-

ever, existing methods either assume label noise is

entirely random or class conditional, neglecting the

fact that label noise is often correlated with current

labels in real-world scenarios.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we first verify that real-world datasets

often deviate from the class-conditional noise as-

sumption. Based on this observation, we introduce

label-dependent noise (LDN), revealing the char-

acteristics of label-dependent noise and designing

a method to generate controllable LDN. Subse-

quently, we propose a novel label-specific denois-

ing framework to enhance multi-label text classifi-

cation under label-dependent noise. Extensive ex-

periments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that

our method significantly improves performance un-

der both synthetic and real-world noise conditions,outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

7 Limitations

Our method leverages the memorization effect

(Arpit et al., 2017) observed in deep learning mod-

els for sample selection and correction. This effect

has not been observed in other traditional machine

learning methods, limiting the applicability of our

framework to deep learning-based approaches only.

Although label-dependent noise (LDN) can be con-

sidered a special case of instance-dependent noise

(IDN) (Chen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2024), our

framework has not been explicitly validated for

handling IDN in our experiments. Calculating the

HSM for each label can be computationally de-

manding, particularly with larger label size datasets.

This could limit the scalability of our approach for

significantly larger datasets.

A From CCN to LDN

A.1 Proof of Theorem 1

Proof. If the CCN assumption is satisfied, then

by Definition 2, the random variable Zjfollows a

Bernoulli distribution with parameters Tj

0,1. For

the joint probability of Zj0andZj1, we have:

P(Zj0=l, Zj1=k)

=P(˜Yj0=l,˜Yj1=k|Yj0= 0, Yj1= 0)

=P(˜Yj0=l|Yj0= 0, Yj1= 0)

·P(˜Yj1=k|Yj0= 0, Yj1= 0)

=P(˜Yj0=l|Yj0= 0)·P(˜Yj1=k|Yj1= 0)

=P(Zj0=l)·P(Zj1=k)

□

A.2 Hypothesis Test

It is assumed that in the actual data, nk,lrepre-

sents the number of samples for the joint distribu-

tion{Zj0=k, Zj1=l}, where k, l∈ {0,1}.

And the total sample size is denoted as n=/summationtext1

i=0/summationtext1

j=0nk,l. Under the assumption of H0,

we can estimate the maximum likelihood estimates

of the parameters:

ˆP(Zj0=k) =nk,0+nk,1

n,

ˆP(Zj1=l) =n0,l+n1,l

n

Therefore,

ˆP(Zj0=k, Zj1=l) =ˆP(Zj0=k)·ˆP(Zj1=l)

From this, we can calculate the test statistic:

χ2=1/summationdisplay

k=01/summationdisplay

l=0(nk,l−n·ˆP(Zj0=k, Zj1=l))2

n·ˆP(Zj0=k, Zj1=l)

Now we apply the chi-square test to the real-world

noise multi-label benchmark Riedel (Chen et al.,

2019). We select the labels “nationality” and

“place_lived” from the Riedel validation set as j0

andj1, respectively. Hypothesis testing results

show that χ2= 940 .5, with a p-value of 1.5e−206.

B.2 Characterizations of Training with LDN

LDN is easier to fit Figure 6 shows the training

and validation loss curves under different noise

settings. It can be observed that the training and

validation loss is lower under LDN compared to

CCN. This suggests that DNNs find it easier to fit

LDN. This finding aligns with our intuition since

the noisy labels under LDN are closely related to

the output labels and can mislead DNNs. In this re-

gard, LDN is more challenging to mitigate because

the label-dependent noise significantly confuses

DNNs, potentially leading to overfitting.

LDN causes relatively less harm Precisely be-

cause LDN is closely related to the output labels, it

causes relatively less harm compared to CCN noise,

as illustrated in Figure 6b. In CCN, many irrele-

vant noisy labels significantly affect the model’s

training, leading to greater harm.5686

C Experiments

C.1 Datasets

We evaluate the proposed model on three synthetic

benchmark datasets and one real-world dataset

for noisy multi-label text classification (NMLTC),

namely MOVIE ,AAPD ,RCV1 , and Riedel .

•MOVIE : The MOVIE dataset is designed

for movie genre classification. It contains

movie plots and genre types extracted from

the IMDB database and is publicly available

1.

•AAPD : The AAPD dataset (Yang et al., 2018)

includes abstracts and corresponding subjects

of 55,840 publications in the field of computer

science from arXiv2.

•RCV1 : The Reuters Corpus V olume I (RCV1)

(Lewis et al., 2004) is a benchmark dataset for

text categorization, consisting of newswire

articles produced by Reuters from 1996 to

19973.

•Riedel : The Riedel dataset (Chen et al., 2019,

2023) was created by aligning entity pairs

from Freebase (a large knowledge graph) with

the New York Times (NYT) corpus. The

dataset includes 53 relations, with training

data from the 2005-2006 corpus and test data

from the 2007 corpus4.

C.2 Evaluation Metrics

Following previous works (Chen et al., 2023), we

use three main metrics which are commonly used

in MLTC evaluations: micro-F1 (mi-F1), macro-F1

(ma-F1), and mAP.

Micro-F1 : This metric is calculated by aggre-

gating the contributions of all classes to compute

the average F1 score. It is particularly useful when

dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it gives equal

weight to each instance. The micro-F1 score is

defined as:

micro-F1 =2×Precision ×Recall

Precision +Recall

Castor-data/tree/master/datasets/AAPD/data

3http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/papers/

volume5/lewis04a/lyrl2004_rcv1v2_README.htm

4https://github.com/AlbertChen1991/nEMwhere Precision and Recall are computed globally

over all instances.

Macro-F1 : Unlike micro-F1, macro-F1 calcu-

lates the F1 score for each class independently and

then takes the average. This metric treats all classes

equally, regardless of their frequencies. It is defined

as:

macro-F1 =1

LL/summationdisplay

i=1F1i

where Lis the number of classes and F1iis the F1

score of class i.

Mean Average Precision (mAP) : mAP is a mea-

sure used to evaluate the ranking quality of the

model’s predictions. It calculates the average pre-

cision across all classes and then averages these

values. It is particularly useful for tasks where

the order of the predictions matters. The mAP is

defined as:

mAP =1

LL/summationdisplay

i=1APi

where AP iis the average precision of class i.

C.3 Implementation Details

Backbone Given that the Riedel dataset is a

multi-instance MLTC dataset, we use the same

backbone as nEM (Chen et al., 2023) for fair com-

parison, i.e., PCNN+ATT. For the other three syn-

thetic datasets, we adopt the pre-trained BERT (De-

vlin et al., 2019) as the backbone of our model,

using the PyTorch implementation from Hugging-

Face Transformers (Wolf et al., 2019). The maxi-

mum document length is set to 512 due to BERT’s

limitations (Devlin et al., 2019), and documents are

either zero-padded or truncated to this length.

All experiments are conducted in a Linux envi-

ronment with a single Tesla A100 GPU (40GB).

Our model is trained using AdamW (Kingma and

Ba, 2015). To optimize GPU memory usage and en-

hance training efficiency, we use automatic mixed

precision (AMP).

The training time for the MOVIE andAAPD

datasets is approximately 5.4 hours and 7.7 hours,

respectively. For the RCV1 andRiedel datasets,

the training time is approximately 9.0 hours and

14.5 hours, respectively.

Hyperparameters Regarding the key hyperpa-

rameters of our proposed method, the coefficient

αand threshold ϵ, we set α= 0.7andϵ= 0.1for

MOVIE . For AAPD andRCV1 , we set α= 0.75687

---

## 第 15 頁

andϵ= 0.05. For the Riedel dataset, we set

α= 0.6andϵ= 0.15. We set θ= 3 for all

datasets. All experiments are run at least three

times with different random seeds, and we report

the average values of the results.

D Related Work

Multi-Label Text Classification Early multi-

label text classification (MLTC) primarily focused

on learning better text representations (Liu et al.,

2017) and capturing label correlations (Zhang et al.,

2021). Label-specific feature learning (You et al.,

2019; Xiao et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2021) intro-

duced label representations to learn specific text

representations for different labels, improving la-

bel differentiation. Recently, some methods (Su

et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023) have

used contrastive learning to achieve more stable

text representations, mitigating the impact of la-

bel imbalance. In contrast, we focus on improving

MLTC performance in the presence of noisy labels.5688
